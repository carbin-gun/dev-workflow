description: Data model and storage design for backend systems
---

Use the `dev-workflow:storage` skill to design data models and storage.

This skill will:
- Identify entities and their relationships
- Define fields, constraints, and indexes
- Choose appropriate storage technologies
- Generate `docs/storage/<system>.md` per backend system

Prerequisites: `docs/requirements.md` and `docs/architecture.md` must exist.

Run `/dev-workflow:storage` to start.
