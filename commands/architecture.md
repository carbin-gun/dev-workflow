description: System architecture design with proactive questioning on boundaries and trade-offs
---

Use the `dev-workflow:architecture` skill to design system architecture.

This skill will:
- Analyze requirements and propose system split
- Challenge system boundaries and data ownership
- Define frontend/backend communication contracts
- Generate `docs/architecture.md` and API contracts

Prerequisite: `docs/requirements.md` must exist.

Run `/dev-workflow:architecture` to start.
